    "#Coroutine Execution\n",
    "# Execution is the same as of a generator. When you call a coroutine, nothing happens. \n",
    "# They only run in response to the next() and send() methods. \n",
    "# Coroutine requires the use of the next statement first so it may start its execution. \n",
    "# Without a next(), it will not start executing. \n",
    "# We can search a coroutine by sending it the keywords as input using object name along with send(). \n",
    "# The keywords to be searched are send inside the parenthesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "# When we run the next() function the first time, the coroutine executes and waits for new input. \n",
    "# After the input is sent to it using the send() function, it executes it and again waits for next input, \n",
    "# and the process goes on like this because we have set the while loop as true, so it will never exit its execution. \n",
    "# In order to make the execution stop, we have to close the coroutine using coroutine.close() function.\n",
